# Analysing Movement Data in Space and Time
## Time-series and data-driven Spatio-temporal animations with 33 birds (Golden Eagles) over ten years.

Movement data in space and time provide critical information about the behaviour of objects studied, i.e. vehicles, humans, and animals.
Insights from spatial and temporal movements drive many human and ecological studies. These studies enable in-depth analysis and understanding of complex processes like an animal and human migration, forest fires and natural disasters as well as mobility and transportation.
