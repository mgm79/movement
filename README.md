Movement data in space and time provide critical information about the behaviour of objects studied, i.e. vehicles, humans, and animals.

Insights from spatial and temporal movements drive many human and ecological studies. These studies enable in-depth analysis and understanding of complex processes like an animal and human migration, forest fires and natural disasters as well as mobility and transportation.

In this article, I perform an in-depth spatiotemporal analysis using a dataset from Movebank. The dataset consists tracks of 33 birds (Golden Eagles) over 10 years in western North America.
